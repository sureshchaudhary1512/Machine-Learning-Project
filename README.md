# Machine Learning 

Machine Learning is s subfield of computer science that gives "computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"
example - Face Recognition, Netflix Recommendation...

In this I learn how to use scikit-learn to implement simple linear regression,Multiple Regression, Non linear Regression ,K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression.The dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars.Then, we split our data into training and test sets, create a model using training set, evaluate your model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value.

# 1. Regression 
Process of predicting a continous value (i.e not Discrete value)
the objective is to minimize  Mean square Error (MSE)

#  Simple Regression, Multiple Regression and Non linear Regression.

# 2. K-Nearest Neighbors

# 3.Logistic Regression
