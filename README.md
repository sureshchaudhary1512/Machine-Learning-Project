# Machine Learning 

Machine Learning is s subfield of computer science that gives "computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"
example - Face Recognition, Netflix Recommendation...

In this I learn following Techniques :

# 1. Regression 
Process of predicting a continous value (i.e not Discrete value)
the objective is to minimize  Mean square Error (MSE)

#  Simple Regression, Multiple Regression and Non linear Regression.
